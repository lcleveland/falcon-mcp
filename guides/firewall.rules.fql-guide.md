# Firewall Management FQL Guide

Use this guide to build the `filter` parameter for:

- `falcon_search_firewall_rules`
- `falcon_search_firewall_rule_groups`
- `falcon_search_firewall_policy_rules`

## Filter Fields

|Field|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|enabled|Boolean|Filter by rule enabled state. Example: enabled:true|
|platform|String|Filter by platform: windows, mac, linux. Rule groups only — on `falcon_search_firewall_rules` and `falcon_search_firewall_policy_rules` this is an unknown property and the request fails. Example: platform:'windows'|
|name|String|Rule or rule group name. For substring matching use the contains operator, name:~'value'. Example: name:~'Block'|
|description|String|Rule or rule group description text search.|
|created_on|Timestamp|Entity creation timestamp.|
|modified_on|Timestamp|Entity last modified timestamp.|

## Sort Fields

Use either `field.asc` / `field.desc` or `field|asc` / `field|desc`.

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|name|Sort by name|
|platform|Sort by platform. Rule groups only|
|created_on|Sort by creation time|
|modified_on|Sort by last modified time|
|enabled|Sort by enabled flag|

## Examples

- Enabled rules:
  - `filter="enabled:true"`
- Windows rule groups (`platform` works on rule groups only):
  - `filter="platform:'windows'"`
- Rules whose name contains a word:
  - `filter="name:~'Block'"`
- Recently modified entities:
  - `sort="modified_on.desc"`

## Notes

- For name matching, use the contains operator `name:~'value'` (case-insensitive,
  matches whole words). A `name:'value*'` glob is treated literally — the `*` is a
  literal character, so the query silently returns nothing. For an arbitrary
  substring (not a whole word), use the wildcard form `name:*'*value*'`. A plain
  `name:'value'` exact match also works when you know the full name.
- `falcon_search_firewall_policy_rules` requires `rule_group.policy_ids` in the
  filter itself; any other filter without it fails. Pass the same value as
  `policy_id`.
- Start broad, then refine your filter if results are empty.
